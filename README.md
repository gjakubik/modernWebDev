### Developed by:
#### Gavin Jakubik
#### Quinn Bardwell

### Feature 1
Basic html only site

### Feature 2
Basic site but with some basic css stylying and a functional/responsive navbar made with pure css

### Feature 3
Site made with preact in order to practice component architecture and async function calls

### Feature 4 
Added Parse as a database, and completed some routing

For this feature, we switched to React instead of Preact to take advantage of some additional tooling, especially because we are not overly concerned with performance and rather the look and functionality of our site. The main tool we wanted to use was Material UI, as its component library will help us to scaffold out something prettier in the time frame required for the project. Also, we wanted to be able to use something like emotion css in order to make styling using React State even easier than conditionally rendering components.
