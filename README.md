### Developed by:
#### Gavin Jakubik
#### Quinn Bardwell

### Feature 1
Basic html only site

### Feature 2
Basic site but with some basic css stylying and a functional/responsive navbar made with pure css

### Feature 3
Site made with preact in order to practice component architecture and async function calls

### Feature 4 
Added Parse as a database, and completed some routing

For this feature, we switched to React instead of Preact to take advantage of some additional tooling, especially because we are not overly concerned with performance and rather the look and functionality of our site. The main tool we wanted to use was Material UI, as its component library will help us to scaffold out something prettier in the time frame required for the project. Also, we wanted to be able to use something like emotion css in order to make styling using React State even easier than conditionally rendering components.
Added user functionality with Parse to make user experiences good. Made use of localStorage to cache a user and allow them on protected routes. Also added more views and data


### Feature 5
This release we added:
- Ability for user to register, log in, and log out
- Protected routes for admin functions
- More data
- A way to store forms and content in Parse
 
In the future, we are planning to add more views, beautify them, and refine the routing to have the user experience make the most sense possible.

### Feature 6
This realease we added:
- User roles!
    - player
    - coach
    - admin
- Events view
- Event input for admins
- Standings improvements
- Team details view with graph
- Players on each team
- Made it publicly hosted on https://gavinjakubik.me/

In the future, we want to continue to flesh out our views and add more functionality attached to the roles.
